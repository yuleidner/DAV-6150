    "\n",
    "#### ALWAYS assess the performance of your models via a variety of performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Relying solely on an accuracy or F1 score when comparing models is __extremely__ unusual in \"real world\" predictive modeling work. Models should __always__ be compared via a variety of metrics to help us enhance our understanding of the true performance of the model. (NOTE: this holds true even if an unbalanced response variable has been balanced via an algorithm). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have two models, both of which have high accuracy, but one has a higher recall score while the other has a higher specificity score, if we rely solely on the accuracy score we will fail to recognize that one of the models is better suited to accurately predicting true positives (the model with higher recall) while the other is better suited to accurately predicting true negatives (the model with higher specificity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, classifiers can be compared on the basis of AIC, BIC (which incorporates a model \"complexity\" penalty), and log-likelihood scores, each of which (as explained in __Module 5__) are different ways of measuring the \"goodness of fit\" of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Both KNN and SVM modeling requires the use of \"scaled\" numeric values\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continous variables need to be of similar scales and preferably free of negative data values, so normalization and min-max scaling are two of the most frequently used scaling methods for KNN + SVM modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical variables need to be converted to digits, so convert nominal categorical variables to binary dummy variables and convert ordinal categorical data into ordered cardinal integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dummy variables + ordered cardinal integers derived from ordinal categorical data __DO NOT__ need to be \"scaled\" for use in a KNN or SVM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Tables to Summarize Your Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing various disparate models in your writeups, use of a summarial table is preferred for enabling a side-by-side comparison of the model performance metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a table created \"by hand\" in Markdown for comparing classification models (note the inclusion of the number of explanatory variables used in each model):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric        | Model 1 | Model 2 | Model 3\n",
    "| ------------- | ------- | ------- | -------\n",
    "| # Indep. Vars |  17     |   13    |   17    \n",
    "| AIC           | 7395.9  | 7511.1  | 7430.4 \n",
    "| Accuracy      | 0.7854  | 0.7863  | 0.7827 \n",
    "| Class.Err.R.  | 0.2145  | 0.2137  | 0.2173 \n",
    "| Precision     | 0.6478  | 0.6594  | 0.6480 \n",
    "| Sensitivity   | 0.4092  | 0.3929  | 0.3864 \n",

    "| F1 Score      | 0.5016  | 0.4924  | 0.4841 \n",
    "| AUC           | 0.6647  | 0.6601  | 0.6556 \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, when comparing models we should __ALWAYS__ assess the number of explanatory variables used to train the model. As we've learned, relatively less complex models are generally preferable to relatively more complex models, particularly if the difference in their performance is marginal."

    "## Final Project Proposal Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "### At least one of your research questions should be indicative of the need to construct a predictive model\n",
    "\n",
    "Research questions that are predicated in identifying \"relationships\" between variables or trying to determine the \"effects\" of one variable on another are not indicative of a need to construct a predictive model. Remember: predictive models __provide estimated values for the given response variable__ relative to the explanatory variables at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions that are merely interested in \"relationships\" and \"effects\" can readily be answered using a variety of basic EDA tools, e.g., correlation metrics, chi^2 tests, visualizations, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if your research questions are not indicative of the need for the estimation of a response variable relative to a set of explanatory variables, you should either re-think your final project OR formulate a research question that is __clearly__ indicative of a need for the use of a predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Every Final Project is required to include the implementation of an ensemble model\n",
    "\n",
    "__Implementation of an ensemble model is NOT \"optional\"__.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Final Project Guidelines document: \"__Project must include the use of at least one ensemble model comprised of the 3 (or more) distinct types of machine learning models you have selected for the Project.__\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Also: \"__Explain your plan for combining the output of your three individual models into a single ensemble model__\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the __Module 5__ assigned readings if you are still unclear on what an __ensemble model__ is or how to approach the development of an effective ensemble algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your ensemble models MUST include at least three different types of models we have covered in this course (i.e., regression, KNN, SVM, clustering, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XG Boosted Trees, Neural Networks, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are proposing to model a continuous response variable, your Final Project MUST include the implementation of something other than just variations on a basic linear or polynomial regression models, e.g., perform regression using at least two of the following: KNN, SVM, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, stochastic gradient descent, XG Boost, Neural Network. Then construct an ensemble model that incorporates the output of each of the 3 types of models you have constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The predictive models you construct should be compared on the basis of a VARIETY of metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "As should be obvious at this point in the course, in \"real world\" data science work practitioners will typically examine a variety of metrics when comparing models rather than relying on a single metric. Model performance metrics were covered in detail in __Module 5__.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to model a __categorical response variable__, your models should be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, AUC score, AIC, BIC, log likelihood, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are planning to model a __numeric response variable__, your models should be measured using metrics such as AIC, BIC, AUC, RMSE, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make sure that what you are proposing is realistic relative to the time available\n",
    "\n",
    "A key component of success in any professional environment is knowing how to properly set expectations regarding the work you have committed to delivering relative to any resource + time limitations. For your Final Project, what you are proposing should be legitimately challenging while being \"completable\" within the time you have available to dedicate to the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your proposed work should be structured in such a way as to limit the possibility of your not being able to complete your proposed work prior to the Final Project deadline / due date.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposals can be revised after they are approved, subject to further review + approval\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, proposed projects often need to be re-worked or adjusted due to the discovery of previously unforeseen challenges. If you encounter an insurmountable challenge in your Final Project work, revised your proposal to address the challenge (while ensuring it still meets all of the requirements outlined in the Final Project Guidelines document) and resubmit it.\n"

    "## Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Clustering ?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Clustering__ (also known as “cluster analysis”) is a data science methodology used for __separating unlabeled data observations into groupings__ wherein the members of each group are more similar to one another than they are to members of other groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use It ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping similar observations together can __give us insight into underlying patterns__ present within those different groupings. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grouping documents based on similarity of topics/content\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grouping similar digital images together based on similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outlier detection (e.g., detecting credit card fraud)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering can also be used for purposes of __reducing the dimensionality of complex data sets__. For example, after identifying suitable clusters within a data set we could add a single new attribute indicative of the new groupings and drop some larger number of relatively \"uninformative\" attributes for purposes of model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Should Data be Standardized for Clustering ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, data is usually __standardized__ prior to the application of a clustering algorithm. Data standardization will ensure that all of the features within a data set are of similar scale. However, standardization can at times result in the removal of useful predictive information from a data set. Therefore, the use of your empirical skills may be prudent, i.e, it may be useful to construct models with and without standardization and then assess their bias + variance and then choose the approach that best balances the bias vs. variance tradeoff."

    "- __Adjust the positions of the centroids__ relative to the data points that have been assigned to them so that the centroids remain at the center of their respective groupings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm continues to iterate until either a predefined number of iterations has been applied __OR__ the centroids have achieved stability (i.e., their positions / values no longer vary, which indicates that the algorithm has, in fact, minimized the \"within cluster\" sum of squares)\n",

    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hierarchical Clustering__ (a.k.a., \"Agglomerative Clustering\") treats each individual data observation as a distinct cluster. Larger clusters are created by iteratively combining relatively proximal clusters until we have finally combined all data observations into a single cluster. This ultimate all-encompassing cluster can be thought of as representing the root of a binary tree. \n",

    "__Step 1__: Assign each data point to its own cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Step 3__: Repeat Step 2 until all clusters have been combined into a single cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, in __divisive clustering__ we start with all observations grouped together within a single cluster and then iteratively work to create sub-clusters of relatively similar observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What is a _Linkage Function_ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A __Linkage Function__ is simply a way of determining the distance between sets of observations (a.k.a., \"clusters\") as a function of the pairwise distances between those sets of observations. There are several different linkage methods typically used with hierarchical clustering algorithms. The methods differ from one another by the way in which they define \"proximity\" between clusters. \n",

    "- __Simple Linkage__ : Also known as __single linkage__; Similar to \"nearest neighbor\" distance; the minimum distance between two clusters\n",

    "\n",
    "To help us identify the \"best\" number of final clusters to utilize in a hierarchical cluster, we can \"draw\" a horizontal line across the __tallest__ branches (i.e., vertical lines) of the \"tree\" while ensuring that none of the underlying clusters overlap with one another. \n",
