    "#### Be very careful when making decisions regarding which attributes or categories to discard from your data\n",
    "\n",
    "The categorical attributes within the NYSED data set provide very valuable information, e.g., there is a very strong relationship between dropout count and school district, between dropout count and county, etc. These relationships could have been discovered via appropriate EDA work. The response variable is Dropouts, so ALL categories could feasibly have been used for purposes of training a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Arbitrarily discarding categorical data results in an enormous amount of valuable predictive information being removed from the dataset, which is never an appropriate outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"Outliers\": Are they or aren't they ?\n",
    "\n",
    "During EDA and Data Preparation we need to be __VERY__ careful regarding our approach to identifying and treating suspected outliers. Be sure to ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Is my approach to identifying outliers appropriate for each of the attributes I believe may have outlying values__? Make sure you do some research / develop some domain knowledge relative to the data you are working with so that you are well-informed regarding the possible __valid__ data values for each of your attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __If I choose to remove observations that I suspect may have outliers from the data set, am I discarding too many observations__ ? If your outlier analysis results in the discarding of a large percentage of the observations contained within a data set, make sure you have a strong set of supporting facts/ domain knowledge that justify your actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Is there some other method (other than deletion) I can make use of when I have identified a likely outlier__? Think about why the supposed outlying values may be present within the data set: Are they actually valid values? Could they be the result of a data entry or computational error of some sort? Are there similar observations within the data set? Can we preserve otherwise valid data via the use of a well-founded imputation of a new value for the supposed outlier? etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use of a mean or median or mode value for imputation purposes should be avoided in most instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of a mean or median or mode value for imputation purposes is very likely to alter the shape of the probability density function of an attribute __unless the number of missing values is very small__. There is almost always a more effective method available for imputation of a missing value. Use of a mean or median or mode should be reserved solely for instances of when no other method proves viable (e.g., no statistically significant imputation model can be identified for the attribute) or when we have a very small number of missing data values (e.g., less than 1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use of the sm.GLM() function for Negative Binomial models requires that we derive a value for the 'alpha' parameter from our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is explained in the Assigned Reading from M6 (https://towardsdatascience.com/negative-binomial-regression-f99031bb25b4), we need to calculate a value for alpha before training a negative binomial regression model. This article (which was highlighted in the __M6 Lecture Notes__ as an appropriate approach to use) https://dius.com.au/2017/08/03/using-statsmodels-glms-to-model-beverage-consumption/#cameron also provides a detailed explanation of how to calculate an appropriate value for alpha. Use of an arbitrary value for the 'alpha' parameter is never appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make sure you discuss + explain your model coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"directionality\" of model coefficients can provide a great deal of information we can use to help explain a model to others. Therefore, we should __always__ review and discuss the directionality of our model coefficients for purposes of explaining to others the effects that various explanatory variables have upon our response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An R^2 metric cannot serve as a basis of comparison between linear models and Poisson or Negative Binomial models\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned in M5 and M6, R^2 is a metric that applies to linear regression models: It measures the strength of a LINEAR relationship between independent and dependent variables. As such it has no applicability whatsoever to the assessment of any predictions made by either negative binomial or regression models. When comparing models of different types, we need to rely upon common metrics, e.g., log likelihood scores, RMSE scores, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Would a linear regression model have been appropriate for this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "As was discussed during the Module 6 Live Session + Lecture Notes, __linear regression models can generate negative non-whole values__. Since our response variable was a cardinal non-negative integer, use of a linear regression model would not be appropriate for purposes of estimating the number of cases of wine likely to be sold."

    "In multinomial logistic regression (MLR), the response variable is __multiclass__, i.e., it has __more than 2 possible values__. Multinomial regression calculates the probability of any observation being assigned to each of the possible classes. Therefore, the regression model must perform at least $n-1$ calculations, where $n$ is the number of possible classifications for the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why $n-1$ calculations? If we have $n$ classes, we can determine the probability of the $n$th class by simply summing the probabilities for each of the other classifications and subtracting that sum from $1$, i.e., \n",
