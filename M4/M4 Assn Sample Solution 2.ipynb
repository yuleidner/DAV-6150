We can see this from how in the table above, most bore numbers only have 1 stroke number. At the same time though, when the values do differ, they could be significant. For example, when bore is 3.62 we see values at both 2.36 which is on the lower end of the range, and at 3.50 which is at the higher end. For this reason we shouldn't vainly throw out one of the variables. This is especially true based on the note I raised when describing the variables about how there is a post on the internet about how long strokes have better fuel efficiency.  \n",
