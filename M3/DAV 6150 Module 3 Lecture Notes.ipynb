    "- When performing exploratory data analysis for numeric data, be sure to __always__ create and analyze both a histogram and a boxplot for each numeric variable. Histograms and boxplots provide us with different insights into the distribution of a numeric variable. For example, histograms can provide us with insight into the __shape__ of a distribution, while boxplots help us locate the median and IQR boundaries. As such, both need to be examined and discussed during EDA work."

    "Prior to constructing a model, it is oftentimes beneficial to consider the addition of new attributes (or \"features\") to our data that you believe will either simplify or enhance the performance of our intended model. We create such \"features\" through the use of the __domain knowledge__ we have for the data we plan to make use of.\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of new attributes/features based on __domain knowledge__ is referred to as __Feature Engineering__.\n",

    "What is a __\"feature\"__? In general, a __feature__ is a characteristic or property of the independent variables we are planning to use for purposes of analysis or model building.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Some examples of __feature engineering__:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Creation of indicator variables based on our domain knowledge__: For example, if we were working with historical data on US housing prices for the years 2000 - 2018, our domain knowledge could tell us that a major collapse in US housing prices occurred during the 2007 - 2012 timeframe due to the 2007 financial crisis, followed by a recovery that started during the year 2012. As such, if we believe that our overall housing price data content may have been tangibly impacted by the financial crisis, we could create a binary indicator variable that flags every data item within the 2007-2012 time period as potentially having been impacted by the financial crisis (assigning a '1' as the indicator), while all other data items are assigned a '0' for the indicator variable's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Combining Sparse Classifications__: With categorical data, \"sparse classes\" are those that have very few observations within a data set. Such \"sparse data\" can cause problems with a wide variety of predictive and machine learning models (e.g., causing the models to \"overfit\" the data use for model training purposes).  These challenges can oftentimes be overcome by combining sparse classes into new classifications that aggregate the sparse items based on some shared characteristic(s). How we identify such \"shared characteristics\" is highly subjective, i.e., we need to apply our __domain knowledge__ to identify them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Adding \"Dummy\" Variables__: We cannot use raw categorical data as input to a model that requires numerical data. Instead, we create a new \"0/1\" binary indicator variable for each categorical data value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Removal of Unused Attributes/Features__: Oftentimes our data sets contain attributes that are of no use whatsoever for modeling purposes, such as unique ID's, text descriptions, and any other data that may be unlikely to be available if the model were placed into a \"production\" environment. Such attributes should be removed from the data we plan to use as input to a model.\n",

    "### How to Approach Feature Engineering?\n",
    "\n",

How relevant are they to the data set, i.e., do they provide new information that isn't available in any other attribute/feature already contained in the data set? Are they duplicative/redundant relative to other features/attributes contained within the data set? etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Refine/improve your new features if needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these problems can be addressed through the use of numeric transforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Box-Cox Transforms__ ( https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/box-cox-transformation/) can be applied to many non-normally distributed numeric variables for purposes of transforming such distributions into dispersements that are more Gaussian in nature. The Box-Cox approach seeks to identify an appropriate exponent (Lambda) to use to transform the distribution of a numeric variable into a more Gaussian distribution. The Lambda value indicates the power to which all data values for a given variable should be raised. However, Box-Cox generally requires that all data values within the variable be __positive__. This limitation can be overcome by simply adding a fixed constant to every value within the variable to ensure that each is greater than zero (e.g., if the variable contains negative values, find the minimum value of the variable, then add its inverse + 1 to __all__ values within the variable (e.g., if the minimum value is -67.12, add (67.12 + 1) to __all__ data values within the variable, thereby ensuring that all values have been scaled by an equivalent amount).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most commonly used Box-Cox transforms are listed in the table shown in the link above. Note that the content of the table provides us with a very clear indication of the transformation formula to be used relative to a given exponent value (Lambda). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can implement Box-Cox transforms via the __sklearn.preprocessing.power_transform()__ function (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.power_transform.html ). This function will automatically test the full range of potential exponent values to identify the transform that minimizes the standard deviation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of scaling methods can also be used to address data quality issues\n",
    "\n",
    "These include normalization, standardization, one-to-many transforms and smoothing splines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalization vs. Standardization: What's the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Normalization__: We use normalization when we know that the distribution of our data does not approximate a Gaussian distribution. A common normalization formula is: $Xnormalized = (X - min(X)) / (max(X) - min(X))$.   Use of this formula will transform all data values to fall within the range of $(0 <= Xnormalized <= 1)$. This formula is also referred to as a \"__Min-Max Scaler__\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Standardization__: We use standardization when we know that the distributions of our variables are relatively Guassian but adhere to very different scales. A common standardization method makes use of the formula for calculating Z scores: $x' = (x - mean(X)) / standdev(X)$ where $X$ represents the variable being standardized and $x$ represents a single data value within that variable. Transforming all data values within a given variable using this approach will result in a transformed variable having a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.  Note that __this is not the same as normalization__: standardization does __NOT__ result in all data values falling with a range of $(0 <= X <= 1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__ONE BIG CAVEAT__: Use of these techniques makes our models much less \"interpretable\" to others. For example, how do we interpret the output of a model wherein one numeric input was transformed using a cubing function while another variable was transformed using an inverse square function? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__ANOTHER BIG CAVEAT__: None of these techniques are guaranteed to improve the performance of machine learning models; sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't. However, some machine learning algorithms require that all explanatory variables be normalized. Data science practioners must therefore rely on empiricism + any guidelines recommended by the developers of any pre-built machine learning algorithms that might want to employ. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__The BOTTOM LINE__: If the application of one of these techniques does not improve the performance of your model relative to its performance when applied to the \"native\" form of your data, __CONTINUE USING THE DATA IN ITS \"NATIVE\" FORMAT\"__. Applying any type of data transformation necessarily increases the complexity of your solution, so if a transformation is adding little to no value to a model, discard the transform."

    "An \"__imbalance__\" occurs within a categorical attribute when one or more of the possible classifications appear within a data set more frequently than do other possible classifications. For example, if we have a categorical attribute with three possible value and the distribution of those classifications within the attribute are such that Class1 appears within 50% of the observations, Class2 appears within 37% of the observations, and Class3 appears within the remaining 13% of observations, we have an \"__imbalanced classification__\" since the Class1 data value dominates the distribution of the attribute.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique__ (\"SMOTE\"): The concept of SMOTE is explained in the Module 3 Assigned readings (see __Machine Learning Pocket References, Chapter 9__). SMOTE works by __synthesizing__ new examples from the minority class. The process works as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "The approach is effective because new synthetic examples from the minority class are created that are __plausible__, meaning their features are relatively to those of existing examples from the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When finished, we then have a balanced class. So if our variable is a binary categorical feature, the __null error rate__ for the data that includes the synthesized observations will be __.50__. With a .50 null error rate, an accuracy metric can be a very effective tool for comparing models.\n",
