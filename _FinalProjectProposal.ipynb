        "\"The Mayor’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is the City government's chief financial agency. OMB's staff of more than 400 analysts assemble and oversee both the expense budget (Fiscal Year 2022 98.7 billion dollars) and capital budget (Fiscal Year 2022 Adopted Capital Budget 17.0 billion dollars). The City of New York funds the activities of approximately 70 city agencies with more than 300,000 full-time and full-time equivalent employees.\n",

        "In addition, OMB plays many other important roles. Among these, the agency is charged with evaluating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of City services and proposals. OMB's economists provide vital information to government officials on the local, United States and world economies. OMB also helps implement the City's borrowing and bond programs and conducts legal reviews of capital projects for financing with bond proceeds.\"[1]\n",

        "Historically in New York City projects have been underestimated. Sometimes this work is accidentally underestimated. Sometimes unforeseen circumstances arise that delay a project or cause its cost to rise. At other times however, project planners intentionally underestimate the cost to get a project started; Once the project is started, politicians are pressured to commit more resources or be accused of wasting the original budget.\n",
